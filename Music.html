    The Roots N Blues N BBQ Festival began in 2007 as a free promotional event
    celebrating the 150-year birthday of Boone County National Bank (now Central
    Bank of Boone County) on the streets of downtown Columbia, Missouri. The 2007
    Roots N Blues N BBQ Festival was organized by advertising agency Woodruff Sweitzer
    with the help of Richard King, then-owner of The Blue Note. The City of Columbia
    shut down ten city blocks in downtown Columbia for the festival, which drew a
    crowd of around 70,000.

    In 2007, the Blues in the Schools program was formed by King and local musician
    and educator TJ Wheeler. The program brings music and cultural education to
    elementary, middle school and high school students across mid-Missouri. In 2013,
    the Roots N Blues Foundation was formed to manage the program.

    In 2008, Thumper Entertainment was established and took over organization and
    operation of the festival. Woodruff Sweitzer and King continued ownership of
    the festival and Thumper Entertainment.

    In 2013, the festival was moved to Stephens Lake Park. After the change of
    location, the festival saw a decline in attendance, from 52,000 in the year
    prior to just over 23,000. The drop in attendance was likely due to an elimination
    of free attendance areas.

    In 2014, the addition of a green vendor program marked a move toward sustainability.
    A set of guidelines for food and craft vendors, which includes replacing styrofoam
    and plastic plates and utensils with biodegradable alternatives, recycling fry
    oil and composting food scraps, intends to help minimize the festival's ecological footprint.
